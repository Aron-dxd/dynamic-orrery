An interactive web application that visualizes the orbits of celestial bodies in our solar system, including planets, Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). This project leverages NASA's public APIs to fetch real-time data and provides users with a dynamic interface to explore and understand celestial mechanics through animations and user selections.
